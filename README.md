# DishPigDilemma

DPG is a dish washing game that was based off of on of our friends' experience with a terrible housemate. The aim of the game is to wash the dishes as they spawn within a time limit. The game was developed during our time studying game development. 

It hilariously turned out to be a failure due to my stubborness with programming and refusing to attempt to resolve the issues differently. It was a failure because I wasn't able to resolve all of the mechanics. 

This was built using UE4(4.17) and so pulling this might be quite troublesome to get working again in the later engines.
